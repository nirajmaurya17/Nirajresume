    <h2> 1) Remote Control Home Appliances using RF Module (2015) </h2>
    <p> The aim of developing this project was to regulate the voltage and control home appliances with a remote by using the RF module. This concept was more reliable and has wider range as compared to an infrared model. </p>

    <h2> 2) Contra-rotation Wind Power Generation (2016)</h2>
    <p> Developed a windmill with the blades on both sides, front and rear, it has a rotor and stator, both as a rotating part. Due to this we get a double output as compared to an ordinary windmill. </p>

    <h2> 3) Pressure converted into electricity (2017) </h2>
    <p> Developed a series parallel combination of piezoelectric plates, so that when pressure is applied to the plates, as a result, we get voltage as an output. </p>

    <h2> 4) Development of Delay Trip Mechanism in any electrical equipment (2017-2018) </h2>
    <p> The aim of developing this project is to avoid nuisance tripping of ACBs (Air Circuit Breakers) in an under-voltage situation.</p>
